# PetHome Project
---
**Project Name:** PetHome App

**Sponsor:** JD

**Software Engineer:** _Edgar Martinez_

### Project Definition
---

This is a Full Stack RESTful Application whose purpose is to encourage people out there to adopt a pet instead of purchasing it. 

There are hundreds of pets outside on the streets that would love to have a home. So, through this application, someone can take them out of the streets and broadcast an adoption. So that, those who would be interested in any pet, can apply to adopt it after verifying some security data.
